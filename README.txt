# thespacecampaign

This is a website for The Space Campaign, a collective of musicians, producers, and hip hop artists in the Louisville area. 
I used Bootstrap to help implement a responsive design. Also, I decided to go with a one-page layout for easier user navigation especially 
for mobile devices.
